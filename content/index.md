To the management team,

Wolt Nicosia,

We are hereby to notify you that we gathered here today the 13th of December 2022, since there has been the changes with base payment rates from €2.40 within 1 km area to €2.26 cents with an unprofessional way, and we the team of wolt couriers of Nicosia, are really dissatisfied with the payment system.

We come up all here together to demand our needs and I hope the management team take this point into consideration.

Our demands,

- Base payment per order €2.60 including marketing compensation within 1 km area.
- Distance payment needs to be as before 0.50 cents per km area.
- Pick up and drop off distance must be clearly mention in the system
- Bonus hrs
- Friday, needs to be same as before as €4 per order,and Saturday,needs to be €3.50 per order.
- Other days £3 per order,
- Surge rule must apply ASAP, when it rains €1.10
- Regarding our fleet managers and respective third parties,

We request them to decrease their commission percentage down to 30% including social insurance.

We found out that some couriers got their wolt account blocked by the management team.

(We humbly request the management team to reactivate the blocked account that has been made today)

Looking for your positive response.

Thank you.

Wolt courier partners, Nicosia
